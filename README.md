# EGCMU
EGCMU electronic gene control and manipulation utility

old project for Windows written entirely in 80x86 assembly language

this was a university project I did back in 2001
it has bugs
I'm posting it here just for fun
I don't recommend using this program as is
You may not even get it to assemble
I plan to rewrite this in Python soon
